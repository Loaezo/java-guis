# java-guis

There are three Java projects in here. As with the calculator project, this is for the Advanced Programming Topics subject of the Computing System Engineer major at the UVEG.

The objective is to show five components using at least three libraries. These libraries are, in this particular case:

- Swing

- JavaFX

- SWT

To run the projects, you can use an IDE such as NetBeans, Eclipse, or VSCode with the required dependencies installed.

To run the Swing example, you don't need to add any external libraries, just run it as is and you should be fine (unless you are usina a very old version of the JDK)

To run both the JavaFX and SWT projects, you need to download the required libraries and add them to the projects. You can find instructions on how to do that at:

- https://openjfx.io/openjfx-docs/#install-java fot JavaFX and
-and https://www.eclipse.org/swt/ for SWT

These are only to show the very basic functionalities for these three libraries, and much more can be done with these tools. Happy coding!
